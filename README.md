**Solutions to code problems using Uiua** 

**Uiua** is a modern, general-purpose, stack-based, array-oriented programming language that emphasizes simplicity, 
beauty, and terse "tacit" code, using unique glyphs (symbols) for functions, making it powerful for data manipulation, 
scripting, image/audio processing, and leveraging first-class arrays and a global stack for elegant operations. 

It's known for its expressive power in small code snippets, often solving complex problems with minimal characters.
